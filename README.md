STM32F446RE I2C Driver Development 
Welcome to the I2C driver development project for the STM32F446RE microcontroller. 
This project demonstrates low-level driver development for the I2C peripheral without using any HAL libraries, directly accessing STM32 registers.

There are source code in this repo used for demanstrating the I2C DRIVER
1) I2C_master_RX: To test the I2C RX working 
2) I2C_master_tx : To test the I2C TX working
